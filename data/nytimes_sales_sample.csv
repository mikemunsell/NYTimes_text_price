Rouf, rouf! Everyone knows Leo-people are something: lucky, radiant, willing, generous, magnetic ...Rouf! And in August, Leo-people have for their Natal Stone that unusual green gem Peridot, celebrated from Antiquity. (We say Peri-dot! not Peri- doe.) Long before 1500 B.C. it was coming from the Red Sea island of Zebirget. The Romans loved it, favored it as a charm against terror and melancholy. In the Middle Ages it was a talisman against the Evil Eye. In recent times Peridot has been found in meteorites. An interesting gem mineral. Small yellow-green Peridots are not rare; many appear in volcanic rocks in our own Southwest. However, large Peridots of the finest clear olive-green color are scarce. Cut brilliantly, the large ones are so appealing they have been termed evening emerald. Greatly favored in Victorian jewelry, Peridot is coming back.t Fortunately, J'.T., recently globe-trotting in Burma, came upon a find of Peridots of superb quality. I take all! And our Chief Lapidary, with Old Eagle-Eye over his shoulder, has lovingly cut them into brilliant gems. We recommend these highly for unusual rings, and especially, for brooches, necklaces, earrings, and even tie-tacks and cuff-links. Advice to the wise: Pick a Peridot this month before our supply of these Burma beauties disappears! Peridot Tie-tacks in 14 kt. gold-a Leo special, only $35.00 to $45.00 Peridot Cuff-links in 14 kt. gold-a Leo special, only $150.00 to $500.00. Peridot Necklaces (very charming)-a Leo special, only $39.00 and $49.00 Peridot Brooches in 14 kt. gold-a Leo special, only $250.00 to $500.00 Peridot Rings in 14 kt. gold.-a Leo special, only $95.00 to $5000.00. We have been hoarding a few quite large Peridots for magnificent brooches that should be made to your order. Only $20.00 to $70.00 per carat (quite reasonable for this fine quality) and really the stuff of heirlooms. Treat yourself! Who deserves better? Rouf! Come on, you Leo-people, rouf!

Most important of all, from a singers standpoint, Tuxedo does not irritate my throat. Tuxedo Does Not Irritate My Throat The non-irritating quality of Tuxedo which Caruso is due to the original praises is due to the original Tuxedo Process by which the tobacco is treated. This process refines the tobacco and absolutely removes all bite and sting. Many thousands of men think they cannot smoke a pipe, for fear the tobacco might bum or parch their mouths. Tuxedo has absolutely done away with any such possibility. You can smoke Tuxedo all day long, pipeful after pipeful, without any irritation whatsoever _ indeed, with increasing pleasure. Tuxedo is made from rich, mild, fragrant Kentucky Burleyãacknowledged to be the finest pipe- tobacco in the worldãaged until it is pipe- perfect and smokes coolly and slowly. No pains, brains or money is spared to make Tuxedo the best of the best. Beyond the shadow of a doubt it stands at the head of them all. You just try weekãand begin today.

At the beginning of this century, Theodore N. Vail, president of AT&T, understood his competition not just as other telephone companies, but as distance, loneliness, separation. He foresaw that the success of his company could end the geographic isolation of man. And in ending that isolation, the company's success would he assured. The vision became reality. By the mid-70s, America had universal telephone service. Today, as the Information Age has begun, there is a new kind of isolation. People are awash in a mounting sea of information, yet unable to connect or work with information in an orderly, useful form. Often, information machines do little to help. They are difficult to use, rigid in their demands, generally unable to work with any but their own kind. Tb overcome this new kind of isolation, we have a new vision: to make the Information Age universal, to help build a worldwide Telecommunity, not just open to all, but inviting. At AT&T. we are now working toward the day when people around the world will be able to handle information in any form ã conversation, data, images, testãas easily as they make a phone call today. And they will be able to get information in a form they can use, whenever they need it, from wherever It is. We envision a vast global network of networks, the merging of communications and computers, linking devices so incredibly capable, they will bend to the will of human beings, rather titan forcing humans to bend to theirs. Obviously, no one company, no one nation, can universalize the Information Age, It will take the best minds of many companies and many nations. The needs of our customers am creating imperatives for our industry. We need common standards and compatibility. We need national and international policies that are open and encouraging. We have the science to construct the systems now. The technology is rapidly taking shape. We are dedicating our minds, our energy, our resourcesãour future to bringing the best of the Information Age to the world. Telecommunity is our goal. Technology is our means.
